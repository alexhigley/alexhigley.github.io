I'm a 23 year old first year Astronomy and Astrophysics PhD student (she/her) at Pennsylvania State University. I grew up in Colorado and got my B.S. 
at the University of Wyoming in Physics and Astronomy. Ouside of astronomy, I love creative writing, art, hiking, and skiing. 


For now, this website is mostly just for me to keep track of things and likely has many mistakes.
